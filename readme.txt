This file is in continuation with the blog I wrote here:  https://coeai19.wixsite.com/coe-ai-bbsr/post/practical-guide-on-training-custom-yolo-model 

yolov3-test.py is the testing file for your model. Open that and proceed according to instructions.
The configuration file is already set, don't touch that
put your weights file in this folder, and give the path name in yolov3-test.py, then execute

congratulations, you have successfully trained and tested yolo!!
